# Python Advanced – Lists as Stacks and Queues (SoftUni)

This repository contains solutions to a series of problems designed to practice working with lists as stacks and queues in Python. These problems cover a variety of scenarios, including basic stack/queue operations, simulation tasks, and logic-intensive algorithms.

Each problem includes a description, input/output format, and examples.

## 📋 Problem Descriptions

### 1. Reverse Numbers
Reads a string of integers and reverses them using a stack. Outputs the reversed numbers.

### 2. Stacked Queries
Simulates a stack with commands to:
- Push elements
- Remove the top
- Print maximum/minimum
At the end, prints all elements from top to bottom.

### 3. Fast Food
Given a quantity of available food and a queue of customer orders:
- Serve them if enough food is left
- Stop when the food is insufficient
Print the biggest order and whether all orders were served.

### 4. Fashion Boutique
Clothes must be arranged on racks of a given capacity:
- Use a stack to simulate clothing removal
- Count how many racks are used, considering rack limits

### 5. Truck Tour
Given petrol pumps (fuel provided and distance to next):
- Find the first pump index where a truck can start and complete the circuit.

### 6. Balanced Parentheses
Checks if a sequence of various types of parentheses is balanced using a stack.

### 7. *Robotics
Simulates robots working on an assembly line:
- Each robot has a processing time
- Assign products to robots as they become available
Logs the name, product, and time of processing.

### 8. *Crossroads
Simulates traffic passing through an intersection:
- Cars must pass within green and free-window time
- Logs crashes or confirms all passed safely

### 9. *Key Revolver
Sam tries to unlock a series of locks using bullets:
- Each bullet has a cost
- Sam earns money if he opens all locks
- Reloads when bullets in barrel run out
Prints whether he succeeded and money earned (or not).

### 10. *Cups and Bottles
Simulates filling cups with bottles of water:
- Uses a queue for cups and stack for bottles
- Prints leftover items and wasted water

## 🧠 Notes

- Problems marked with * are more advanced and may involve simulations or complex logic.
- The exercises rely heavily on understanding and using Python’s `deque`, `list`, and stack/queue logic patterns.
